# Red-Black-Tree-
Implementation of reb black tree and its modification to store product details like id cost and qty


Aim: 
	Write a program to implement & Analysis RBT and to store the details of product (id,cost,qty).
Objectives:
    • Initialization Red Black Tree
    • Perform primitive operations of RBT such as Insertion, Deletion and searching.
    • Display the details of products (id,cost,qty) in RBT format.
Methodology:
A red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in RBT has an extra bit as compare to BST, and that bit is color (red or black) of the node.
Properties:
    • Binary Search Tree : every RBT should be binary search tree
    • Color Property : every node is either red or black
    • Root Node : root node of RBT is always black
    • Internal Node : If a node is Red then its both children are black
    • Black Depth Property : for each node, all path from that node to descendants external nodes contains the same no of black tree.
Time Complexity of operations:
Insertion: O(logn)
Deletion: O(logn)
Searching: O(logn) 
Conclusion:
	Here we can conclude that time complexity of RBT for all primitive operations is depend upon the no of nodes present in it.
